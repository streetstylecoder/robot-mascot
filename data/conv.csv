What you are experiencing is common for people who have experienced abuse, neglect, or other forms of trauma.

Generally, the lack of connection can occur when you don't feel heard, understood or valued. These are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness.

She says it's because of my anger.,"Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking  only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate.",Are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your life? which may lead to smething like this?,"Anyone who asks whether or not they have a problem, usually feels at least partly, that they do have a problem.Your answer to the question is what matters.Since you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them, the reactions you're having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events, either in the near or distant past.Be aware, consider, reflect on Â how you usually handle feeling angry. Â Based on your description here, it is quite likely that the anger you show toward what you call 'little things' reflect anger at much bigger matters that are uncomfortable and not easy to understand.Knowing more about the more significant matters causing frustration for you, may very likely decrease reacting angrily toward smaller matters.","I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband. I think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot.

I just don't know how to get back to my old self.","i need answers to my angry, possessiveness, and urges","Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting.

Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend.

We have been together for a year and a half. He got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago, and we have a infant.

Every fight is worse than the last one, and I don't know what to do. He doesn't let me speak because he's louder than me, and that makes me feel frustrated. I have another problem: English is my second language. I pay half of the bills, and every time I want to speak to him, he kicks me out of the house. He apologizes sometimes. I feel like I'm the only one fighting for this. He agreed to have counseling.",Why did my boyfriend hit himself in the face during an argument?,"When I got home, my boyfriend and I got into an argument. He got upset and he started hitting his face. That is the first time he has ever done that, but I would be lying if I said that didn't scare me. I locked myself in the room.","A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves.A surface situation, like, a store told you they'd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesn't have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it is.

Childhood trauma and past negative effects may lead to situations like this, do you hav something like this in mind which may have happened?",,,,,,,,
domesticviolence,How do I get my partner to stop verbally abusing me?,"Every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. Nothing I do is right, and once she's mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. She says it isnâ€™t abuse, itâ€™s just angry verbal bashing, and that itâ€™s different.

He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything. Iâ€™m always there when he needs my help.

One thing you could try is to them your partner when they're not angry about other things to talk about,"It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you don't want to leave them. Is it because of other reasons? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for anyone. So if the abuse continues, it would be more beneficial for you to move out.On the other hand, if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state, you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging.","Firstly, here, changes need to be made quickly.

I keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.",,"Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain, there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well. Â I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns. Â Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals. Â Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when re-engaging in personal relationships.","The first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change. Frequently our problems keep us in denial. Although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling, it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone. The best course of treatment for you is to treat the problem head on.What else are you feeling along with this?","You are not hopeless, as you can see there are many people who care about your well being and believe you can overcome this.

I feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. They do nothing to try and help.",,,,Your friend needs to admit they have a problem. It can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them. Like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways. I would listen to them and discuss why they feel that they need to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation.,I would suggest having a conversation with them. Usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed. Â Be aware of behavior changes and mood swings. Be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help.,I'm sorry to hear that they has been having such a rough time. They're lucky to have you on his side. What do you think would be the root of the problem?,,,,,,,,
